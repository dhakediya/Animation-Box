# 🔷 Blue Square Animation

This project showcases a simple yet creative animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 Description

A **blue square** moves in a square path when clicked. The animation follows this flow:

- Starts as a **blue square** in the center.
- On click:
  - Moves in a **square path** (top → right → bottom → left).
  - **Fades out** at the right-bottom then completing the square.
  - The movement **repeats** smoothly.
  - After the final loop, it returns to its **original position**.
  - Finally, it **transforms into a black circle**.

This project demonstrates basic animation principles and event-driven behavior in web development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (for animation and transitions)
- JavaScript (for event handling and dynamic control)
